## To Test Performance:

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Performance tab
3. Record a page load session
4. Check console for Core Web Vitals metrics (development only)
5. Use Lighthouse audit for comprehensive performance analysis

## Additional Recommendations:

1. **Image Compression**: Consider compressing large images in `/public/Images/`
   - Data.png (219KB) and Website.png (215KB) could be optimized
2. **Font Optimization**: Already using `display: swap` for better font loading
3. **Service Worker**: Consider implementing for caching strategies
4. **Critical CSS**: Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content
